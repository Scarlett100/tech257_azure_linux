# LINUX

Linux is a clone of Unix. Unix used to be used on large mainframes, but linux can be used on small devices. Always logs you into the home directory.

### How to find out where you are: Present Working Directory.
``` 
pwd
``` 

###  how to find out user
``` 
whoami
``` 
###  how to list files

``` 
ls
``` 
###  how to list hidden files

``` 
ls -a
``` 

### How to disconnect from vm (if you are on)
Doesn't stop vm, just disconnects.

``` 
exit
``` 

Bash

Bash is an abbreviation for Bourne Again Shell
cat /etc/shells
ps -p $$ <-- shows you the processes>


### How to see what commands you have used.
it will keep the history even if you log out and back in


``` 
history

# to clear history
history -c
``` 


### to run an old command in history eg. in your history command 5

``` 
!5
``` 

# <center>  Navigating files and folder <center/>

cd . <- means current folder

###  Root vs Home
to get you back to **home** directory
``` 
cd 
cd ~ <-- can also be done
``` 

If at beginning means you are at the root of the directory
``` 
/ 
``` 
will get you to **root** directory
``` 
cd /
sudo su  
exit <-- will take you back to admin user>
``` 
![hello](..images/)
 *****************add exit super user**********
####???

``` 
ls -la
ls -l if you just want non hidden files
``` 
As you can see below, the listings  that start with d on the left hand side are directories, whilst the ones with "-" are files.

### Curl

used to transfer data

``` 
curl https://cdn.britannica.com/39/7139-050-A88818BB/Himalayan-chocolate-point.jpg
``` 

you are asking the terminal to put binary on the screen, this wiil not work. But if we try to save the file like below, it should work

curl https://cdn.britannica.com/39/7139-050-A88818BB/Himalayan-chocolate-point.jpg --output cat.jpg

we can check with a quick ls. it will show us cat.jpg exists

![alt](../images/ls.png)

we can also check the file type with file 
``` 
<filename.filetype>
``` 

![alt](../images/file_type.png)

copy a file from one filetype to another
``` 
cp cat.jpg cat.txt
``` 


![alt](../images/copyfile.png)


We can see from an ls it is made, but from a file type command it still sees it as a jpeg.


# rename file

``` 
cp cat.jpg cat.txt
``` 
![alt](../images/rename_file.png)

# removing file
``` 
rm different-cat.jpg
``` 

![alt](../images/removing%20files.png)
``` 
# make a directory(folder)
``` 
mkdir my pictures # <-- will make two folders because there is a space 
``` 
mkdir my_pictures
``` 
# Help 

if we wanted to delete,

the two folder you may have made with mkdir my pictures you can do

rm --help
<command need help with> --help
rm -d? ****lookk into that**

# Remove

``` 
rm -r my <-- a little dangerous, better to manually delete file.
``` 
# Making files with spaces in them

```
mkdir "my pictures" <-- how to get a folder with a space, but not recommended. 

cd my\ pictures <-- is another alternative to get there

###  How to create a file
``` 
touch <filename>.<filetype>
``` 
``` 

head -2 chicken joke.txt
tail -2 chicken-joke.txt
nl chicken-joke.txt <-will print out all lines 
cat chicken-joke.txt


# Grep
``` 

***what is grep???*** 

cat chicken-joke.txt | grep the <--will print all the places with the word "the" in it>
``` 

![alt](../images/grep.png)

# Update and upgrade
would usually run these one after the other on a vm when beginning. But NEVER on a production vm without permission.
``` 
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y
``` 

# Tree

Tree allows us to visually see our directory/file set up.

# Move a file

mv chicken-joke.txt funny_stuff/
![image](../images/move_that_file.png)


move chicken joke back to home directory
mv funny_stuff/chicken-joke.txt .
mv funny_stuff/chicken-joke.txt home <-- tried this but it renamed it and moved it>


#MOVE CHICKEN JOKE TO FUNNYU JOKE
mv home funny_stuff/funny_jokes/

![image](../images/mv%20chicken-joke_to_funny_joke.png)

#rename chicken joke to badjoke.txt
mv chicken-text.txt bad-joke.txt

move badjoke from funny jokes to funny stuff
``` 
# A few different ways:
mv bad-joke.txt ..
mv bad-joke.txt ~/funny_stuff
```
![ALT](../images/MOVEMOVEMOVE.png) 

remember one dot is where you are currently 2 dots are to go previous
# minitask
