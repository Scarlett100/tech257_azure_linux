#  What is cloud computing?

Instead of using a personal computer or server, cloud computing describes a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data.

#  History of Cloud Computing

Once upon a time there was a single physical machine that ran a single app/site, that was dedicated to a specific single cause (a company). There were multiple problems with this method called **Dedicated Servers**. <br>
The biggest problems were: <br>
<br>
                * Expensive <br>
                * High Maintenence <br>
                * High Security <br>
                <br>
A solution to this was to create Virtual Private Servers:
One physical machine dedicated to a single business.
This physical machine can run multiple web-apps/sites because it has virtual sub machines.


## What can you do with Cloud Computing?

Big data analytics: capacity to analyse expansive datasets. This can be used for tasks like business intelligence, marketing analytics and scientific research.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML): Cloud platforms offer access to powerful AI and ML tools and services. This allows businesses to leverage these technologies without having to invest in expensive hardware and expertise.

Collaboration: Cloud-based tools can facilitate communication and collaboration between teams and individuals, even if they are located in different places. This can be essential for businesses with remote workers or geographically dispersed teams.

Streaming services:  From music and movies to video games, cloud computing powers many of the streaming services we use today.  These services allow you to access content on-demand from any device with an internet connection.

## What are the 4 TYPES/MODELS of Cloud?

* private <br>
* public <br>
* hybrid <br>
* community cloud

## What are the different types of cloud service?

* Infrastructure as a service
* platform as a service 
* Software as a service

## Advantages/Disadvantages of the Cloud? Specifically for a business.

* Cost savings: You only pay for the resources you use, no more purchasing expensive computing hardware, now you can pay as you go.

* Environmentally friendly: Less hardware means less useage of materials and a greater reduction in your environmental impact.

* Security: Cloud services have security experts and can achieve high levels of security even for small companies through the touch of a button.

##  What is OpEx vs CapEx?

CAPEX pertains to spending money upfront on physical hardware. CAPEX can include but not exclusive too server costs, storage costs, disaster recovery, technical personal, backup and archive costs, network costs etc.The downside of this is that you are almost guessing what you will spend.

OPEX  costs pertain to on premise datacentre costs. The customer does not worry about any physical costs, this now lies with the service provider. can focus on training staff on cloud, customising and improving product. With OPEX billing is based on Compute and Storage usage metrics.

## Marketshare 

As shown below in the diagram you can see the market share has been with AWS, Microsoft and Google for a long time.

## How does Cloud Computing work as a business model?

Pay as you go: You pay for what you use, no upfront costs.

## What sorts of things do you usually need to pay for when using the cloud?

Within the cloud you may need to pay for database useage, bucket useage, virtual machine useage, VPC, VPN useage. Another useage.
