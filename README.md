#  What is cloud computing?

Instead of using a personal computer or server, cloud computing describes a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data.

#  History of Cloud Computing

Once upon a time there was a single physical machine that ran a single app/site, that was dedicated to a specific single cause (a company). There were multiple problems with this method called **Dedicated Servers**. <br>
The biggest problems were: <br>
<br>
                * Expensive <br>
                * High Maintenence <br>
                * High Security <br>
                <br>
A solution to this was to create Virtual Private Servers:
One physical machine dedicated to a single business.
This physical machine can run multiple web-apps/sites because it has virtual sub machines.



## What can you do with Cloud Computing?

Big data analytics: capacity to analyse expansive datasets. This can be used for tasks like business intelligence, marketing analytics and scientific research.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML): Cloud platforms offer access to powerful AI and ML tools and services. This allows businesses to leverage these technologies without having to invest in expensive hardware and expertise.

Collaboration: Cloud-based tools can facilitate communication and collaboration between teams and individuals, even if they are located in different places. This can be essential for businesses with remote workers or geographically dispersed teams.

Streaming services:  From music and movies to video games, cloud computing powers many of the streaming services we use today.  These services allow you to access content on-demand from any device with an internet connection.


## What are the 4 TYPES/MODELS of Cloud?

* private: eg. Hospitals, Government <br>
* public: businesses <br>
* hybrid:  companies not fully needing or wanting to jump to cloud or need to migrate slowly <br>
* community cloud:
<br>

## What are the different types of cloud service?

![alt text](https://cdn1.plesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/02113945/large-visual-1.jpg)


* Infrastructure as a service
* platform as a service 
* Software as a service

# Advantages/Disadvantages of the Cloud? Specifically for a business.

## <center> Advantages <center/>

* Cost savings: You only pay for the resources you use, no more purchasing expensive computing hardware, now you can pay as you go.<br>

* Environmentally friendly: Less hardware means less useage of materials and a greater reduction in your environmental impact. <br>

* Security: Cloud services have security experts and can achieve high levels of security even for small companies through the touch of a button. <br>

* Access: A smaller org may not have options to have so many resources/services available to them at the beginning, with cloud, they have that from the beginning.
<br>
* SLA: an agreement of guaranteed uptime , to achieve a particular level of availabilty. It means you don't have the responsibilty to take care of this. <br>

## <center> Disadvantages <center/>


* Cost: may not actually be cheaper because you will have to train staff, pay for more services.

* Security: may be open to more breaches.


# <center> What is OpEx vs CapEx? <center/>

## <center> CapEx <center/>

CAPEX pertains to spending money upfront on physical hardware. CAPEX can include but not exclusive too server costs, storage costs, disaster recovery, technical personal, backup and archive costs, network costs etc.The downside of this is that you are almost guessing what you will spend.
## <center> OpEx <center/>

OPEX  costs pertain to on premise datacentre costs. The customer does not worry about any physical costs, this now lies with the service provider. can focus on training staff on cloud, customising and improving product. With OPEX billing is based on Compute and Storage usage metrics.

## <center> Marketshare <center/>

As shown below in the diagram you can see the market share has been with AWS, Microsoft and Google for a long time.
![Alt text](https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cloud-market-growth-2019-1.png)

### AWS
*"With over 100 availability Availability Zones across 31 geographic regions, AWS currently takes up over 34% of the global cloud computing market share."*
<br>

### Microsoft Azure

**"Since 2010 it has gained market share to 23% from AWS by appealing to enterprises, hybrid cloud embracers, and companies that mainly use Microsoft products, including Office 365."**
<br>

### Google Cloud Platform

GCP has a **"niche for itself through innovations across Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Analytics, and Kubernetes, the popular container management platform."**

## <center> The 3 largest Cloud providers known for (What makes them popular?) <center/>

![alt](https://www.cloudzero.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cloud-service-providers-market-share.webp)

<center> Microsoft Azure:  <center/><br>
<center>Google Cloud Platform: GCP has expertise in Data and Analytics.  
<center/> <br>
<center>Amazon Web Services: AWS provides more services <center/><br>



## <center> 4 pillars of DevOps? How do they link into the Cloud? <center/>

* Culture and Collaboration: Global, bigger picture, unlimited scalability. <br>
* Measurement and metrics: Billing and useage calculators <br>
* Automation and Tooling: AWS Lambda is great example, a single trigger. <br>
* Continuous Learning and Improvement: small incremental changes with big impacts. <br>

## <center> How does Cloud Computing work as a business model? <center/>

Mostly Pay as you go but paying u[front can give big discounts!

* Scalability
* elasticity

## What sorts of things do you usually need to pay for when using the cloud?

Within the cloud you may need to pay for database useage, bucket useage, virtual machine useage, VPC, VPN useage. Another useage.
