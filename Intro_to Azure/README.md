If you haven't already, make a new repo called tech257-azure-linux or similar.

In that repo, make in an appropriate section for intro-to-azure (or similar) + a README.md

Ask Google Bard (or Chat GPT 4) to explain to you:

The basics of Azure

Azure regions and availability zones: how they work and include up-to-date diagrams to help

How is Azure structured/organised (resources you create on there)?

What types/categories of services does Azure provide?

# <center> The Azure Pricing Calculator? </center>

You should use the Azure Pricing Calculator for several reasons:

Before deploying to Azure:

* **Cost estimation and budgeting**: <br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* primary use case. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* calculator helps you estimate the potential costs for specific Azure services for your use case.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Gets you a breakdown of costs once you enter resources such as instance types, database needs etc.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Can now plan and adjust cloud budget realistically and accurately. Allowing for informed decisions.<br>


* Service comparison:  The calculator allows you to compare pricing options for different Azure services. This can be helpful when deciding which service best suits your needs and budget. For example, you can compare costs of different virtual machine sizes or storage options.

* Identifying potential savings:  The calculator can reveal opportunities to optimize your costs. It might show you  more cost-effective service tiers or pricing models based on your usage patterns.  For example, it could suggest using reserved instances for predictable workloads or leveraging spot pricing for flexible workloads.

After deploying to Azure (for existing customers):

Cost monitoring and analysis: While the calculator is primarily for pre-deployment estimates, it can also be used to analyze existing Azure costs. If you're already using Azure, you can log in with your billing account to see a more precise cost breakdown based on your actual usage. This helps you identify areas for potential cost reduction and optimize your cloud spending over time.
Here's a good rule of thumb:

Use the Azure Pricing Calculator whenever you're considering using Azure services for a new project or want to understand the potential costs associated with different resource configurations.

In the README.md, add + personalise the content with your own comments, "take-aways", things you've learnt. Supplement the content with extra research where you feel your understanding is weaker.

Understand the content so you are ready to be asked interview questions on the topic
