If you haven't already, make a new repo called tech257-azure-linux or similar.

In that repo, make in an appropriate section for intro-to-azure (or similar) + a README.md

Ask Google Bard (or Chat GPT 4) to explain to you:

The basics of Azure

Azure regions and availability zones: how they work and include up-to-date diagrams to help

How is Azure structured/organised (resources you create on there)?

What types/categories of services does Azure provide?

Why/when use the Azure Pricing Calculator?

In the README.md, add + personalise the content with your own comments, "take-aways", things you've learnt. Supplement the content with extra research where you feel your understanding is weaker.

Understand the content so you are ready to be asked interview questions on the topic
